## Features of BaaS
- Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud service model in which developers outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they **only have to write and maintain the frontend**. 
- BaaS vendors provide pre-written software for activities that take place on servers, such as 
	- User authentication 
	- Database management
	- Push notifications (for mobile apps)

- The main difference between serverless and BaaS is that scaling is managed by the cloud providers in serverless. In case of BaaS you have to manage your own scaling.
