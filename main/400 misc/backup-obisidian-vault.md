- I already back it up using GDrive.
- I want to back it up using github or make it a compressed zip at the end of the day.
- If I want to upload it to github I would want to do it in a different account. Mostly in obsidian sync github account from backups obsidian google account. I don't want to do it since I don't want to use multiple keys.
	- But may be I can add myself to the project.
- The best case scenario would be to somehow publish my notes online and then use a subdomain to point to it.
- I am going for a github based approach since I don't trust google drive a lot, difficult to read notes.
- Also I like the point that use Gdrive for sync and use something else for backup in which you can't delete things.

## Conclusion
- Using GitHub for backup
